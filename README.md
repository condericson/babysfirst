## About
There are few things parents treasure more than the ability to reflect on the happy memories of their child. Whether it's the first time she took a step, the first time he threw a ball, or graduation day from high school, these memories come with them a dialogue of experience that can be best expressed with the written word and pictures. [First Memories] brings that family photo album or the personal journal to the cloud, accessible anywhere.

This application combines the use of the React front end framework with Node.js on the back end.

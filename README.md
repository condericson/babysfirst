## About
There are few things parents treasure more than the ability to reflect on the happy memories of their child. Whether it's the first time she took a step, the first time he threw a ball, or graduation day from high school, these memories come with them a dialogue of experience that can be best expressed with the written word and pictures. [First Memories] brings that family photo album or the personal journal to the cloud, accessible anywhere.
